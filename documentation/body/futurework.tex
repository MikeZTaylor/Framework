The original plan of the framework was to create a documentation website showcasing the framework, and detailing everything about the framework with code snippets, and examples of usage. When the framework was been developed, a kitchen sink website was created first to ensure that the development was working as it should. Due to time constraints, a finished website fully demonstrating the framework hasn't been developed, currently a single page website used for testing has been built with all the features of the framework akin to a kitchen sink example. 

For the continuation of the project, a website will be built using the framework, and have documentation on each of the core functionality of the framework. In continuing the developing the framework, the following features would be added to the framework to make it more robust, and eliminate the need to write extra CSS:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Badges to show unread content or to be used to display notifications
	\item Breadcrumbs to show the user where they are are on a website
	\item Tabs for tabbed navigation
	\item Off canvas sidebar that slides in and out of a page, ideal for mobile design
	\item Modal to create modal dialog boxes
	\item Inverse to reverse the style of any component for light or dark backgrounds
\end{itemize}

In addition to CSS, jQuery features to be added that would help the framework work more seamlessly such as making links active in the navigation bar, ensuring that the footer section always stays at the bottom of the page, regardless of page height, adding close options to the alerts, et al.
