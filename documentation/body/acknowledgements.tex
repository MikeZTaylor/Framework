I want to first thank my partner first for inspiring me to do this degree and for taking care of everything else that I did not deem important while I was in fourth year. Letting me focus on getting the best degree I could, you are my unsung hero. To his family for their help and support over these past four years, I am eternally grateful. To my dog Moxxi, who loved me unconditionally and helped me through the bad days. 

Secondly to my friends, especially Erica Chai the only one left standing along side of me, you all made college, especially fourth year bearable for me. You made me laugh when i did not think it was possible. Without friends like you this journey would not have been the same. To the wonderful people at Vitamin Studios that helped answer my queries, and aided in the graphic design aspects of the project. 

Thirdly to all my lecturers who I have had the privilege to learn from these past four years. You have made this journey all the worth more. You all have inspired me in ways you will never know, and I want to give you all my sincerest thanks for that!

Lastly but not least, to my supervisor who pushed me to make this project the success that it is. When I started this project I merely had an idea of what I wanted, you helped me mould this project into something that I can be proud of.
